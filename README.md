## SETUP

### CTD
Need to install packages in requirements.txt and plug in CTD to computer.

Requires an environment variable to be set, named *SEABIRD_CTD_PORT*
that indicates which COM port the CTD is connected on (eg COM6).






(Maybe) Need to set up and install Erlang and RabbitMQ server and configure ports. As of 10/23/2017 not required, but might be.
