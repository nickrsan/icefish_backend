<h2>The Team</h2>
<h3>Paul A. Cziko</h3>
Evolutionary biologist, tinkerer, diver and the Principal Investigator of the project B-195 at McMurdo Station, Antarctica. Paul studies the physiology and ecology of Antarctic fishes, especially as it relates to the evolution of their freezing avoidance strategies. He led the deployment of the McMurdo Oceanographic Observatory in order to better understand the environmental context in which these fishes evolved. He has completed 7 seasons in Antarctica and 150 dives under the ice in support of Antarctic research projects. Paul is a Research Assistant Professor at the University of Oregon, Eugene, USA.

<h3>Arthur L. DeVries</h3>
<p>Art is the Co-Principal Investigator of the project and one of the most deployed Antarctic scientists ever. He began his Antarctic career in 1961 and has travelled to Antarctica more than 50 times. With his discovery of antifreeze proteins in Antarctic fishes in the 1970s, he opened an entirely new field of research into the physiology of cold adaptation and freezing avoidance. He is Professor Emeritus at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA.</p>

<h3>Henry Kaiser</h3>
<p>Scientific diver, musician, videographer and more. Henry fills a number of important roles that every science group needs but rarely has. In twelve deployments to McMurdo Station and nearby field camps, Henry has supported numerous and varied science projects, both above and below the ice.</p>

<h3>Konrad Meister</h3>
<p>Protein biophysicist, field technician and fisherman extraordinaire. When Konrad isn't using state-of-the-art technology to better understand the interactions between antifreeze proteins and ice, he's organizing field trips to our local fishing holes, supporting our diving, maintaining equipment, and doing much of the heavy lifting necessary to catch our study species.</p>

<h3>Nick Santos</h3>
<p>IT specialist, hacker, programmer, GIS researcher, and much, much more. In Nick's first season on the ice, he's supporting our technology needs and developing the software infrastructure for our observatory. Nick's work will ensure that critical data is archived, and interesting and exciting data is made available to the broader public.</p>
